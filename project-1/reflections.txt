Your response goes here!
What new skills have you learned?
I have never used the superscript or strikethrough tag before now, so I got to learn how to use those tags.

What has been easy?
This project was pretty easy all around. It might have taken me 20 minutes including going off to look up the tags and how they're used.

What's been difficult?
It hard to know what I don't know. For example I thought the "By" in "By Christopher Watkins" was lighter than the rest on the text, but I wasn't sure how to make that text lighter. It seemed like I needed some sort of header, but it was just a simple p tag.

How have you used the problem solving strategies?
I have used them to take my time and solve one bite sized problem at a time so a to avoid making mistakes and completing my work in total.
